About Me
Hello! My name is Parth Raval. I am a second year student of computer engineering with a passion for full stack web development. I enjoy in doing frontend and backend part both in web development. This website is a reflection of my interests and projects that I am working on.

Purpose of This Website

Portfolio: A collection of my projects, including descriptions and links to live demos or repositories.
Contact: Information on how to get in touch with me for collaborations, questions, or just to say hello!

How This Website Works
This website is built using GitHub Pages, which allows me to host static websites directly from my GitHub repository. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works:
Repository: The source code for this website is stored in a GitHub repository. You can find it [insert link to your repository if applicable].
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript: The website is built using standard web technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, Bootstrap for responsiveness, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Deployment: When I push changes to the main branch of my repository, GitHub Pages automatically updates the website, making it easy to keep everything up to date.
